# Gemini Multimodal Playground

A web application that demonstrates the capabilities of Google's Gemini Pro Vision model for multimodal interactions. This playground allows users to experiment with image and text inputs to explore the model's understanding and response generation.

## Features

- Upload and process images with Gemini Pro Vision
- Interactive chat interface with real-time responses
- Support for both image and text inputs
- Modern and intuitive user interface
- Secure API authentication
- Backend logging for debugging and analytics
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile users
- Easily extendable architecture for additional features

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js (or any preferred frontend framework) for a seamless user experience
- **Backend**: Uses Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django) to handle API requests and integrate with Gemini Pro Vision
- **Database**: Optional database support (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing user interactions and logs
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud APIs for AI processing and authentication

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Cloud API credentials (Gemini Pro Vision access required)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)
- Flask/FastAPI/Django (for backend API development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-multimodal-playground.git
cd gemini-multimodal-playground
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
python app.py  # Flask example
```

2. Start the frontend application:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
